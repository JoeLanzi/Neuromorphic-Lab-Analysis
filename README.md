# Neuromorphic Lab Analysis
Wavelet analysis of neuromorphic camera data values, reading from CSV files


Test (1) to (5) focuses on comparission of individual events within a time period.
The result from this was inconclusive.

Test (6) focuses on the polarity number based on the coordinate location of each event, creating a density pattern.
-Next step is to input data into machine learning algorithm
